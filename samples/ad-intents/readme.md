## How it works

Ad intents works by scanning your pages for opportunities to help your users find something they might be looking for. Based on your content and what your users may be interested in, ad intents automatically:

- Converts existing text on your page into links. [Learn more about ad intent links](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/13829157).
- Places anchors that appear at the bottom of your page. [Learn more about ad intent anchors](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/13844047?hl=en).

When a user interacts with a link or anchor, it opens a dialog that shows users relevant, organic search results with ads and can help to increase your earnings. When a user closes the dialog, they remain on the same page on your site.
