How Auto ads work
Auto ads use Google's smart technology to:

Understand your page structure
Detect any existing Google ads on your page. (Note that we're not able to detect ads from other ad networks.)
Automatically place new ads based on different elements such as your page layout, the amount of content on your page, and your existing Google ads. Occasionally, Auto ads might place two ads next to each other (regardless of the ads' network origin).
If you make a change to your site we'll detect it and reanalyze your page.


Choose the ad load for your Auto ads


Ad load lets you control the number of ads you show on your pages. We offer different levels of ad load so you can choose the one that best suits your requirements. The ad load you choose determines the number of in-page Auto ads that Google places on your pages.
