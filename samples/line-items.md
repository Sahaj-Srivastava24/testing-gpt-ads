# What are Line Items in Google Ad Manager?

Line items help Google to choose the right buyer for your inventory based on type, ad size, and deal for impressions. If you’re a part of the ad industry, you might be working with line items daily or have at least heard this term a few times.

But do you understand what line items are, their priorities, and how they operate?

In this article, we will explain what line items are, what their types are, and how you can use them to optimize your ad campaign strategy!

## What are Line Items in GAM?

A line item refers to an advertiser’s commitment to purchase a specific number of ad impressions (CPM), user clicks (CPC), or time (CPD) on specific dates and at predetermined rates.

It is essential to note that a line item is uniquely linked to a single order and cannot exist independently.

Moreover, orders can include multiple line items, making them a versatile tool for managing ad campaigns.

Line items contain information about how specific ad creatives are intended to serve your website or app, pricing, and other delivery details.

Line items include information such as:

- The number of times your advertiser or buyer wants an ad creative to serve.
- The cost you negotiated for the campaign.
- Start and end times of the campaign.
- Targeting that allows your advertiser or buyer to reach its intended audience or demographic.

## How do Line Items Work?

Here are 5 steps that show how line items work in Google Ad Manager (GAM):

1. The user launches a page.
2. The browser sends content and ad requests to the GAM server.
   - In case of an ad request, the GAM server stores the details of the webpage inventory (e.g., ad location, size, user’s first-party data (if allowed), time zone, targeting details, etc.)
3. GAM then goes through all the line items to see which match the generated ad request.
4. When the eligible line items are found, GAM sorts them by priority.
   - In simple terms–the line item with the highest priority gets to run for the webpage, and added buyers get the request for the user impressions.
   - For line items with equal priority (Ad Network, Bulk, and Price Priority), GAM focuses on time out and the highest bid.
5. The highest bidder within the specified time wins the impression.
